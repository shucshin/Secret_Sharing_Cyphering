Try Hard Fool - The Growlers

Pause but don't quit
Don't let a heart forget
Walk the dotted line
With heavy footsteps

Nobody said it would be easy
And if it was, you wouldn't want it, want it

It's just a game though you ain't no child
You gotta laugh every once in a while
Without danger there ain't no style
But you can only try so hard

Poems in the sky
Reflection, wet and cold
Between death and birth
We're only growing old

Nobody said it would be easy
And if it was you wouldn't want it anyway

It's just a game though you ain't no child
You gotta cry every once in a while
Without danger there ain't no style
But you can only try so hard, so hard, so hard
And you can only try so hard

Some fools never learn to take their turn
It's just a game though you ain't no child
You gotta laugh every once in a while
Without danger there ain't no style
But you can only try so hard

It's just a game thought you ain't no child
You gotta laugh every once in a while
Without danger there ain't no style
But you can only try so hard
